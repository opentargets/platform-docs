# Clinical Precedence

The 'Clinical Precedence' widget in the Open Targets Platform provides users with an overview of the clinical development stage of each drug, as defined by the EMBL-EBI ChEMBL database. This widget is designed to aid in the prioritisation of drug targets by highlighting the extent of clinical development for each drug.

The clinical development stages are categorised as follows:

<table><thead><tr><th width="158.33333333333331">Phase Value</th><th width="187">Phase Name</th><th>Phase Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>4</td><td>Phase IV</td><td>Drugs have already been given regulatory approval for the treatment of specific diseases in certain regions. Only Phase IV trials for approved indications are included</td></tr><tr><td>3 / 2 / 1</td><td>Phase III, II, and I</td><td>Drugs are currently being tested in clinical trials for potential indications</td></tr><tr><td>0.5</td><td>Early Phase I</td><td>Drugs that are in the preliminary stages of clinical testing</td></tr><tr><td>-1</td><td>Unknown</td><td>Drug or clinical candidate drug where a clinical phase cannot be assigned</td></tr><tr><td>null</td><td>Preclinical</td><td>Compounds with bioactivity data that have not yet reached clinical trials</td></tr></tbody></table>



In the Platform, this information offers valuable insights into the clinical development of potential drug targets. By showing the current phase of clinical development, the 'Clinical Precedence' widget can inform decisions about target prioritisation and help identify drugs that may be suitable for repurposing or further development.&#x20;
