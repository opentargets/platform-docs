# Entity profile pages

Profile pages aim to describe the entity and provide relevant annotation that might become informative at different stages of the drug development process.

At the top of each profile page, we provide a description for the entity, a series of cross-references to other databases, as well as synonyms provided by some of the upstream data sources.

Next, a list of **summary widgets** display the availability of certain category; summary widgets in grey report the lack of information for the given category.

Further down the page, **detail widgets** provide the full extent of information available in the Platform about a particular summary widget. A description explains the nature of the displayed information, as well as the source of the data.
