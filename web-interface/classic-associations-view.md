# Evidence pages

Evidence pages aim to summarise all the available evidence for a given target-disease pair. Evidence displayed in the page includes **indirect evidence**, so the user can interrogate evidence annotated with descendants of the disease of interest.

The structure of the page follows the same structure as the profile pages including descriptions, summary widgets, and detail widgets.

To navigate to an evidence page, from the associations page, use the kebab menu icon, next to the name of a target or disease.
