# Web interface

The web interface available at [https://platform.opentargets.org](https://platform.opentargets.org/) constitutes the first point of access for most of the Platform users. The site provides a unified search box connected to a series of tools allowing users to query different therapeutic hypotheses.

When possible, users can download the displayed information, but we invite users to visit the [Data access](data-access/) section when more complex queries are under consideration.
