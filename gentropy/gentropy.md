# Gentropy

Gentropy is an open-source Python package to facilitate the interpretation and analysis of GWAS and functional genomic studies for target identification. The Platform leverages Gentropy to perform post-GWAS analysis and derive the evidence and datasets for web portal visualisation.

Gentropy provides a set of data models, data ingestion methods and statistical analysis organised in discrete steps to maximise re-usability. Gentropy is designed with scalability in mind, so it's suitable for small dedicated analysis but also for the high-performing orchestrated tasks required to generate the data-lake that populates the Open Targets Platform.
