Welcome!

The [Open Targets Platform](https://platform.opentargets.org) is a comprehensive tool that supports systematic identification and prioritisation of potential therapeutic drug targets.

By integrating publicly available datasets including data generated by the [Open Targets consortium](https://www.opentargets.org/), the Platform builds and scores target-disease associations to assist in drug target identification and prioritisation. It also integrates relevant annotation information about targets, diseases/phenotypes, drugs, variants, studies, and credible sets as well as their most relevant relationships.

The Platform is a freely available resource that is actively maintained with quarterly updates. Our [data can be accessed](data-access/) through an intuitive web user interface, an API, and data downloads. Likewise, our pipeline and infrastructure codebases are open-source and can be used to create a self-hosted private instance of the Platform with custom data. For more information, please review our [Licence documentation](licence/) and, if you use our data and/or pipelines, please cite [our latest publication](citation.md).

Check out [our blog](https://blog.opentargets.org) to learn more about the Platform and the Open Targets research programme.
