  Platform

# ðŸ†• Platform infrastructure

## Introduction

The Open Targets Platform infrastructure stack is composed of three layers, data, backend and frontend.

1. Data layer
   1. Opensearch â€” Contains the bulk of the data
   2. Clickhouse â€” Contains data related to associations view
2. Backend layer
   1. API â€” The main backend application, providing the GraphQL engine
   2. OpenAI-API â€” The summarizing engine for literature section
3. Frontend layer
   1. Web â€” A React SPA web application

Currently this infrastructure is hosted on Google Cloud, using a load-balanced, globally distributed and highly scalable deployment based on Terraform.
