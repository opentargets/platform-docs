# Release outputs on AWS

### Reading Open Targets Platform data hosted on AWS

From 2026, Open Targets Platform datasets are also made available through Amazon's [Registry of Open Data](https://registry.opendata.aws/) initiative.&#x20;

**Dataset location:**

`s3://open-targets-public-data-releases/platform/`

Users can interact with these datasets in several ways without needing to download a local copy.&#x20;

This [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/opentargets/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/reading_data_from_aws.ipynb#scrollTo=79ce23e9-8572-4d7c-b2dd-a7a022920ebb) provides guided examples demonstrating how to access these datasets from the dedicated AWS S3 bucket using [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [polars](https://pola.rs/) and [pyspark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/index.html).
